## OBS-Events
Quick plugin to allow communication with the OBS websocket server directly from Warudo. All events should be there as nodes but some of the returned data may need tranlsating from JObjects, other than this the flows should still work.

This project used the great https://github.com/BarRaider/obs-websocket-dotnet as a base, and bridges the events from this to Warudo's own event system.
